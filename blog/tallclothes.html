                <p>I'm just going to start this post off with a disclaimer: I'm not a fashionista or style expert. But as most other 21-year-olds, I like to at least try (some days). The hardest part about being a 6'5 girl is finding clothes my length that won't break the bank. Over the years I've come up with my own tips and tricks.</p>

                <h3>Online Shopping Is Your Friend</h3>
                <p>I (like many other people) used to be reluctant to buy clothing online. At first it seems like a bad idea because you can't try the clothes on first, and returning seems like it'd be a hassle. In reality, it's pretty convenient. Most stores I've ordered from have free returns (and include a shipping label when you receive your clothes). Most of the time the clothes fit pretty well because the size guides are usually pretty accurate. Lately my favorite online store has been <a href="www.asos.com">Asos</a>. Their clothes seem pretty high-quality and they even have a tall section. I used to order a lot from <a href="www.alloyapparel.com">Alloy</a> but lately their quality's gone downhill. </p>

                <h3>My Favorite Jeans Hack</h3>
                <p>My friends think this is funny, but if I never told them I did this then nobody would know. Usually I wear a 37" jean inseam, but regular-length jeans are usually around 31" or 33".  When regular-length skinny jeans go on sale in the store, I buy some that fit me well, except for the length. If I roll them up once, they look exactly like capris. If I roll them down and wear them with boots, nobody knows they're too short. </p>

                <p>PICTURE HERE</p>

                <h3>Shirts Too Short?</h3>
                <p>If you have a long torso and your shirts always feel too short, luckily high-waisted jeans are in style, and they're extra flattering when you've got height. With high-waisted jeans, you don't have to worry as much about your shirt being too short and exposing your stomach or lower back. </p>

                <h3>Alter Important Items</h3>
                <p>Even through online shopping, some clothes are too expensive in sizes that would fit me. (I'm looking at you, dresses that would look like shirts on me). In these cases, I buy something that's my length but might not fit correctly, and spend the money to get it altered. Luckily my mom can sew well enough for most cases, but otherwise it's not extremely expensive depending on where you live. And then the item of clothing will fit you perfectly! </p>


                <h3>Take Care Of Your Clothes!</h3>
                <p>Finding clothes that fit well is pointless if you don't take steps to ensure they don't shrink. This might be obvious, but <b>do not</b> dry your jeans or shirts you care about. Instead, hang them up to dry. If you have jeans that are borderline too-short, when they're wet you can actually stretch them out so they'll dry a tad bit longer. Just pull length-wise on the legs really hard and then hang them up to dry. </p>

                <h3>Confidence Is Key! </h3>
                <p>Even if your clothes aren't <i>exactly</i> your size, nobody will notice if you have confidence and rock your height. Good posture goes a long way!</p>
