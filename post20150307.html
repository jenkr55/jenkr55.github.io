<p>I grew up in the country outside of a small town of about 650 people called Hanover. The nearest Wal-Mart was a 30 minute drive away. My high school class had 22 people. I lived 10 miles out of town in the middle of nowhere. During my senior year of high school, I decided to go to college in Lincoln, Nebraska. Although most people don't consider Lincoln a big city, its population is about 300,000 people, which is over 460 times the size of Hanover. My family made trips there several times a year for shopping, dentist, eye doctor, etc, so I was already familiar with Lincoln and I figured moving there wouldn't be a huge adjustment. 
</p><p>
Even though the general stress of my first semester of college probably didn't help, I had a tough time getting to sleep when starting college. I realized that it was because my room felt so bright at night and it wasn't silent outside either. In the country, there's no random lights outside (unless you put one on your property), so my room was always as pitch black as possible. The only sounds I would hear coming from outside were crickets and grasshoppers in the summer, and sometimes the occasional coyote. Learning to sleep wearing a sleep mask and also the sleep deprivation from my new study schedule and social life quickly made me tired enough to sleep, probably under any set of conditions.
</p><p>
In high school, if you met someone in the hallways or on the sidewalk, you always knew who they were so you'd give a quick "hey" or have a small conversation. When I started college, I realized I had no idea how to react to the stranger coming my way on the sidewalk. No eye contact felt rude and awkward but making eye contact didn't seem right either. Smile? Say hey? Awkwardly pull out my phone and pretend to text? I had to watch with other people a few times to learn what was socially acceptable. 
</p><p>
Growing up, my family lived in the country where garbage trucks didn't come so we burned all of the trash that we could, and the rest we would drive to the dump whenever we got a few bags filled up. My parents repeatedly told my brothers and I that metal and batteries never went into the burnable trash. It still feels like there's something wrong with throwing a metal can in the trash even now, so I guess my dad really succeeded at drilling that into my head!
</p><p>
Speaking of trash, we also never threw food away when I lived at home unless it was too rancid for the dogs. We had two huge outside dogs and several farm cats to eat it all. This included old-ish food from the fridge, bones, and scraps from our plates. It felt like nothing went to waste because the dogs or cats would get it later, and they loved it. My first semester in the dorms, it felt wrong to throw my uneaten food in the trash. Even now I still have an aversion to it. Maybe this is why my roommate pokes fun at my avoidance of throwing away any food, but it just feels so wasteful.
</p><p>
I actually had to remind myself to look both ways before crossing the street in Lincoln because there were actually cars on the streets...
</p><p>
Some of the everyday sights you take for granted in the city were all new to me. I remember how shocked I was when I saw a homeless man sleeping outside for the first time. I walked past a man getting arrested. (more)
